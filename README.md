This query uses multiple joins to connect a series of separate tables by their Primary and Foreign Keys to get a comprehensive view of the databaseâ€™s information. You can see we have some inconsistencies within the column titles, such as CustId being used on the Customer tables and CustomerId being used on the OrderId table - not a big problem by any means, but something to be tided up. 

I ordered the resulting table by Country and Order Date in descending order to make it easier to read.
